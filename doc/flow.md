# Gather Frames

- Using the videos and the annotations Frames of drones can get gathered
  - how big should the frame be?
    - manageable to detect border of the drone to cut out a specific area?
  - can I gather bird frames?
    - are those necessary?

# Pre-Processing Frames

- unify
  - Color
    - experiment how important colors are
  - Alignment -> already correct aligned
  - frame size
- normalize
- One-Hot Encode Labels

# Processing Frames

- create model (sequential)
- add layers


# Feed AI 

- smash in the flattened results
- compare train results to test results
